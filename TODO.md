## 🛠️ Website To-Do List

### 🌟 Next Steps

- [ ] Use real email server - need to get real domain before we can implement this
- [ ] Create separate development and production databases
- [ ] Add real products
- [ ] Add pagination once we have a large number of products to view
- [ ] Add company, support, and legal pages, as well as a complete site map

### 🪨 Code Stability
- [ ] Add unit tests and e2e tests to ensure complete site functionality
- [ ] Price multipier is stored in jwt token so could be publicly available. Instead, give account an obfuscated letter, which translates into a multiplier value.
- [ ] Update Github Readme with screenshots and updated site features/design/functionality
- [ ] Allow users to change their email address
- [ ] Make the site more responsive and put loading animations in using client side components
- [ ] Use local db server in dev environments

### 💰 Payment Processing 

- [ ] Add ability to accept payments
- [ ] Add shipping charges to checkout process

### 🎨 Design Changes

- [ ] Update logos with proper graphics
- [ ] Try out different colour schemes
- [ ] Create container and card utility classes
- [ ] Improve the inspiration detail page - it's a bit dull, but needs real content to see what it can look like
 
### 🛍️ Tracking / Marketing

- [ ] Add tracking to learn how the users are using the site
- [ ] Coupon code / discount offers
- [ ] Collect user contact email for newsletter (overstock or flash sales)
- [ ] Signup for newsletter to get a percentage off your first order

### 🔍 Questions Features

- [ ] Should repeat orders add to the existing cart, or replace it? This should probably be a user preference that pops up when the user clicks on the reorder button?
- [ ] Boxlot selection behaviour?
- [ ] Editing product details should be saved automatically without needed to press save?
- [ ] Figure out a fair way to figure out the value of this app?
