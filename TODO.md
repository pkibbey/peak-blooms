## 🛠️ Website To-Do List

- [ ] Update logos with proper graphics
- [ ] Try our different colour schemes
- [ ] Add price multiplier per account
- [ ] Add ability to buy bulk boxlots for large scale event planners
- [ ] Repeat customers / Bulk buying or repeat orders / Coupon code
- [ ] Add tracking to learn how the users are using the site
- [ ] Collect user contact email for newsletter (overstock or flash sales)
- [ ] Signup for newsletter to get a percentage off your first order
- [ ] Detect missing images that have failed to load and add tracking to this, so that the entry can be fixed
- [ ] make sure that the data is not just hidden from the UI, but also not returned in the database calls for unauthenticated users also
- [ ] remove "use client" from as many pages as possible, to load the site from the server for speed and security reasons
- [ ] Add image upload for content management instead of url fields
- [ ] Allow download of content as CSV, so that they can be edited offline and uploaded to modify the content
- [ ] Go through the site and make sure that the components are separated well. Some of the files are pretty big, and could be split up a little to keep the code cleaner and make future changes more isolated
- [ ] Validate all form fields using zod + react-hook-form instead of relying on html validation
- [ ] Allow users to change their email address
- [ ] Should repeat orders add to the existing cart, or replace it? This should probably be a user preference that pops up when the user clicks on the reorder button
