# Language & Style Guide - Peak Blooms

This guide explains how to write for Peak Blooms' website: tone, voice, phrasing, and practical examples. Use this as the single source for site-wide language decisions so copy remains consistent, mission-aligned, and effective for our primary audience: florists, retailers, and event planners.

## Core voice principles

- Professional, not formal - expert without being cold. Think: a seasoned trade partner who knows floristry.
- Warm and supportive - approachable guidance for busy professionals.
- B2B-focused - write for business customers who make buying and design decisions, not general consumers.
- Clear and direct - avoid marketing fluff and make the value obvious.
- Specific, verifiable claims - prefer "highest quality" and "freshest flowers" over subjective superlatives like "best".

## Key themes & priority phrases

Use these phrases consistently when they apply:

- "Partner" / "Partnership": emphasizes collaborative relationship.
- "Highest quality" / "Freshest flowers": quality promise (avoid "best").
- "Competitive wholesale pricing": price positioning for trade customers.
- "Sustainable sourcing": values & sourcing claim.
- "Reliable / Timely delivery": logistics & trust.
- "Design partner" / "professional-grade": for Inspirations and design resources.

## Structural rules (how to compose copy)

- Lead with the user's benefit. Start with the primary professional value (e.g., quality, reliability, pricing).
- Be concise. Use short paragraphs and clear headers. B2B readers scan copy quickly.
- Use active voice for clarity and energy. Prefer "We partner with growers" over "We are partnered with growers."
- Use consistent capitalization for product/feature names (e.g., "Featured Collections", "Boxlot Center").

## Tone examples - do and don't

- Hero / Headline
  - Do: "Premium wholesale flowers for creative professionals"
  - Don't: "Fresh flowers for everyone - perfect for gifts"

- Subhead / Support line
  - Do: "Competitive wholesale pricing, sustainable sourcing, and reliable local delivery—designed for florists and event pros."
  - Don't: "Low prices, big savings - great deals for anyone."

- Product descriptions
  - Do: "Carefully selected stems at peak freshness - ideal for high-volume events and retail displays."
  - Don't: "These flowers are simply gorgeous and the best choice for any use."

- CTA language
  - Do: "Browse catalog" / "Explore boxlots" / "Start shopping"
  - Don't: "Shop now!" (too consumer-oriented and generic)

## Page-specific guidance

- Homepage / hero banners: Speak to partnership and outcomes. Use headings that identify the audience: "for florists, retailers, and event planners." Keep CTAs oriented to professional needs (catalogs, boxlots, wholesale pricing).
- Shop & product lists: Highlight wholesale benefits and quality. Include delivery and availability details where relevant.
- Collections & Featured Collections: Emphasize seasonality, curation, and partnerships with growers - explain why selection changes.
- Inspirations: Position as professional design references and training resources - not just pretty images.
- About / Footer: Summarize trust-building promises (service, sourcing, delivery) succinctly and consistently.

## Accessibility and SEO notes

- Write helpful, descriptive alt text and page titles that include trade-oriented terms where relevant ("bulk boxlots for florists" vs "bulk flowers").
- Keep headings semantic and sequential (H1 once per page, H2 for major sections).
- Use short sentences where possible; this helps readability and screen readers.

## Words & phrases to avoid

- Avoid generic superlatives without context: "best", "ultimate".
- Avoid B2C phrases: "perfect gift", "for everyone", "daily deals".
- Avoid vague claims: instead of "unique", say what makes it different (e.g., "seasonally curated from local growers").

## Quick checklist for editors

Before publishing, verify:
- Does this speak to trade customers (florists / retailers / event pros)?
- Does it use partnership language when appropriate?
- Are claims specific & verifiable (quality, sourcing, pricing, delivery)?
- Is the copy concise and scannable for busy professionals?
