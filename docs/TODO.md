## 🛠️ Website To-Do List

### 🌟 Next Steps

- [ ] Use real email server - need to get real domain before we can implement this
- [ ] Turn the development of this into a website using git commits
- [ ] Instead of having dead images, I should be able to either generate or have fallback images via an API to use as placeholder images

### 🪨 Code Stability
- [ ] Add unit tests and e2e tests to ensure complete site functionality

### 💰 Payment Processing 

- [ ] Add ability to accept payments
- [ ] Add shipping information - shipping is free for the moment, so shipping should be described as such

### 🎨 Design Changes

- [ ] Update logos with proper graphics
- [ ] Try out different colour schemes
- [ ] Make the site feel more responsive by puting loading animations in using client side components
- [ ] Perform a design review with either humans, or AI, or both
 
### 🛍️ Tracking / Marketing

- [ ] Add tracking to learn how the users are using the site
- [ ] Coupon code / discount offers / discount code for newsletter sign up
