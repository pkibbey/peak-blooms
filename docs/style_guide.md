# Style Guide

## Aesthetic Overview
The site aims for a clean, professional, modern, and high-quality aesthetic that stands out from typical wholesale flower sites. It balances efficient B2B utility with B2C visual appeal.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors (Backgrounds & Layout)
- **Whites:** Clean backgrounds for content areas.
- **Greys:** Various shades for text, borders, and subtle background differentiation.
  - *Light Grey:* Backgrounds for sections.
  - *Medium Grey:* Borders, secondary text.
  - *Dark Grey:* Primary text, headings.

### Accent Colors
- **Elegant Green:** Used for primary actions (e.g., "Add to Cart"), success states, and nature-related highlights.
- **Crimson:** Used for call-to-action buttons, alerts, or specific design highlights to add vibrancy and contrast.

## UI Components

### Cards (Products, Content)
- **Shape:** Very subtle rounded corners (e.g., `rounded-sm` or `rounded-md` in Tailwind).
- **Depth:** Slight drop shadows to create a sense of depth and separation from the background (e.g., `shadow-sm` or `shadow-md`).
- **Behavior:** Clean hover states that might slightly elevate the card or intensify the shadow.

### Navigation
- **Structure:** Global navigation bar.
- **Behavior:** No mouseover dropdowns. All main categories should be visible or accessible via click.

### Typography
- **Font Family:** [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) (Default Next.js font) or a similar clean Sans-Serif.
- **Readability:** High contrast dark grey text on white/light backgrounds.

## Layout Principles
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace to maintain a "clean" look.
- **Grid:** Responsive grid layout for product catalogs.
- **Imagery:** High-quality flower photography is central to the design.
